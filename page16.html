Activities are fun because it’s subjective, meaning, nothing’s wrong. That’s the kind of activity that I wanted, though, it’s essay form-- because that’s where I’m not really good at. This week, we tackled about what design means, we gave our opinions on what our minds thinking when we heard the word ‘design’. And I learned that what design means is the sole purpose of that thing, and that is why it is formed in that way. We had an activity about how we design an elevator with a thousand floors. My idea is mainly put a tablet-like object outside every elevator for the users to input their desired floor level before entering the elevator. While I was thinking of this proposal, I thought that it would really solve the problem, but when others presented their ideas, I noticed that my proposal is vague and not the best solution for that matter. In this activity, I learned that everything can be improved with the help of the continuous development of the technology and of course the broad critical thinking and idea making of everyone.<br></p><p></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="carousel-item slider-fullscreen-image" data-bg-video-slide="false" style="background-image: url(assets/images/prototype-300x168.jpg);"><div class="container container-slide"><div class="image_wrapper"><div class="mbr-overlay" style="opacity: 0.8;"></div><img src="assets/images/prototype-300x168.jpg"><div class="carousel-caption justify-content-center"><div class="col-10 align-center"><h2 class="mbr-fonts-style display-2">&nbsp;Reflection 2: "Need Finding and Paper Prototype"&nbsp;</h2><p class="lead mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 1.2rem;">In our second week in USERDES, we are challenged to work as a team, and what we have to do is to create an application that will solve the problem that we have thought. Need Finding is the topic that was discussed in this week, it is a process of looking for a solution in the problem, and by that you must fully understand what your problem is for you to provide the best solution that you can make.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
<br>In my group, the problem that we tried to solve is the language barrier, we all know that there are lots of languages, and we can’t practice all of them. So, we planned to create an app that will translate someone’s idea into someone whom he is talking to’s language. Dialect also plays a role in this app, example you want to translate Cebuano to Ilocano. My group and I decided to pursue this app because we believe that a good communication is the way to share precise data or information. The next meeting, we discussed it in front to have our prof’s comment and to know other’s opinion about it. After that, we will create a prototype of the application to have a look of our model, and its features. 
<br>
<br>I learned that teamwork is important because at first, we can’t think of a problem that can be solved easily, everyone gave their proposal but unfortunately, it is vague and unreasonable. But when we combine the problems that we are proposing, we have thought of this idea, the what ifs helps us to build problem that can possibly solve. &nbsp;<br></p><p></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="carousel-item slider-fullscreen-image" data-bg-video-slide="false" style="background-image: url(assets/images/web-2000x1111.png);"><div class="container container-slide"><div class="image_wrapper"><div class="mbr-overlay" style="opacity: 0.8;"></div><img src="assets/images/web-2000x1111.png"><div class="carousel-caption justify-content-center"><div class="col-10 align-center"><h2 class="mbr-fonts-style display-2">&nbsp;Reflection 3: "First Web Application using Github and Heroku"&nbsp;<br><br></h2><p class="lead mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem; background-color: transparent;">On our 3rd week in USERDES, we are given a task to create a webpage where in our Activity 1 will be the content. I have a background in creating a webpage because I had web designing subject back in my Junior high school. I use html instead of sublime because I used to work on it before and it is a good practice for me to see in myself if I still remember what I have learned. I created a simple webpage and didn’t search for a template because I want to showcase my knowledge about it, and I don’t want my professor to have high expectation on me whenever she asked us to create a webpage. So overall, the task wasn’t that challenging that I have to search a lot. But it is a practice for us to have an introduction about designing a webpage because I know that sooner or later, this subject will be our backbone creating a front-end in mobile or web programming.&nbsp;</span></p><p>I had a hard time using Heroku so I asked help with my classmates but in github, I already knew how to use it since during bootcamp in Senior high school, our professor already introduced it to us.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="carousel-item slider-fullscreen-image" data-bg-video-slide="false" style="background-image: url(assets/images/15-q1-gardon-684x350.png);"><div class="container container-slide"><div class="image_wrapper"><div class="mbr-overlay" style="opacity: 0.8; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></div><img src="assets/images/15-q1-gardon-684x350.png"><div class="carousel-caption justify-content-center"><div class="col-10 align-left"><h2 class="mbr-fonts-style display-2">Reflection 4: "Userinyerface - Worst UI Practice"<br><br></h2><p class="lead mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The Userinyerface application is a brain destroyer haha. I agreed that this is the worst UI practice, first is that it is not user-friendly because the instructions are confusing, and you have to read carefully in order not to misunderstand the statements. Also, the size of the texts is small which might be cause of unreadable content. 
<br>
<br>While we were solving the puzzle, I thought that this would be easy since the only way to solve it is to use your common sense. But this one is really insane, everything is unusual and when you didn’t work carefully, you will consume more time solving and repeating everything, especially the last part. &nbsp;</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="carousel-item slider-fullscreen-image active" data-bg-video-slide="false" style="background-image: url(assets/images/r5-2000x1333.jpg);"><div class="container container-slide"><div class="image_wrapper"><div class="mbr-overlay" style="opacity: 0.8;"></div><img src="assets/images/r5-2000x1333.jpg"><div class="carousel-caption justify-content-center"><div class="col-10 align-center"><h2 class="mbr-fonts-style display-2">Reflection 5: "SOCIT Fest"<br><br></h2><p class="lead mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"></p><p>My experience last Socit Fest was amazing, I experienced being an organizer of an event and we had lots of conflict especially in our class time but I’m thankful that we handled the events’ flow thoroughly and even we had problems with time management we still succeed. I’m very impressed to the presidents of every organization under Socit because they were able to finish everything despite of conflicts like lack of budget, time and sleep.  
<br>I’m a committee in events in JPCS and I am one of the responsible in preparing and designing the place where we will be doing the event. It was fun doing this kind of task with friends and others whom I just met on that day. And because of the event, I met new friends of mine. 
</p><br><p><br>My expectation for the next Socit fest will be more organized and hopefully we can have more time to prepare and discussed the flow of the event so that it will be easier and close to being successful. The new members are very neat and hardworking, I’m sure that next Socit fest will be much colorful and remarkable.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="carousel-item slider-fullscreen-image" data-bg-video-slide="false" style="background-image: url(assets/images/r6-1024x709.jpg);"><div class="container container-slide"><div class="image_wrapper"><div class="mbr-overlay" style="opacity: 0.8; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></div><img src="assets/images/r6-1024x709.jpg"><div class="carousel-caption justify-content-center"><div class="col-10 align-left"><h2 class="mbr-fonts-style display-2">Reflection 6: "First Half of USERDES"<br><br></h2><p class="lead mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem; background-color: transparent;">The First half of USERDES was challenging, even though we are at the introduction part of everything, we do a lot of things. But those things helped us to broaden our knowledge regarding how to design effectively and how not to overdesign things. A person must design based on the purpose of the thing that he/she will be doing.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>
<br>The challenges that I had is I can’t manage my time efficiently because of too much activities to do in different courses. And what I did was I lend some of my personal time in doing some stuff and sometimes I sleep late to finish it one by one.
<br>
<br>I expect that in the final part of this term, we will learn new things and the unfinished task that we are still working on will be enhanced and well designed.&nbsp;</p><p></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><a data-app-prevent-settings="" class="carousel-control carousel-control-prev" role="button" data-slide="prev" href="#slider2-3q"><span aria-hidden="true" class="mbri-left mbr-iconfont"></span><span class="sr-only">Previous</span></a><a data-app-prevent-settings="" class="carousel-control carousel-control-next" role="button" data-slide="next" href="#slider2-3q"><span aria-hidden="true" class="mbri-right mbr-iconfont"></span><span class="sr-only">Next</span></a></div></div>
